# make:pest

#### Archived: Pest:Test dissapeared so did this component

The missing make:pest command!

[Pest](https://pestphp.com/) is an amazing test suite written by Caleb Porzio for any PHP application but primarily used with Laravel.

Pest has a command
    
    pest:test MyNewTest

That creates a new Pest Test, but I always want to type

     make:pest MyNewTest

If you want to do this too, then this is the package for you.

     composer require tobya/makepest --dev

and off you go.
